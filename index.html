                    <p>
                        I need a taste<br>
                        I can almost face myself<br>
                        There is a way, a never-ending pavement cast<br>
                        Land on a date such a long, long way, way back<br>
                        Which has a crave for the path that ends in black<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I gotta fade another day<br>
                        I can taste it, I can feel it<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And you can have, you can have my face right now<br>
                        Standing back from the lapse<br>
                        Children are what you are<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tim Gilbert weighs internally more than the scales say<br>
                        Carries a weight such that no eyes see in air<br>
                        Jean Nealy views from a place where time is flat<br>
                        She sees a haze that could penetrate more black<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She's gotta seize who sees<br>
                        And she wants to live in lightning<br>
                        God, shrinking multiplicity you are<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        And you can have, you can have my fate right now<br>
                        Another grave, another blank<br>
                        Children are what you are<br>
                        Landscapes come and pass my way<br>
                        Vision goes in a car<br>
                        What you say, another day<br>
                        Above you, you mostly are<br>
                        And in the cradle, a newborn babe<br>
                        Is a dot in the war<br>
                        Spreads its wings, intervenes<br>
                        Human atop a star<br>
                    </p>
